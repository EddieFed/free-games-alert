# Eddie's Free Games Alert!
#### A simple mms messenger that will let you know what's free!

One day I realized how many free games I was missing from humble bundle, steam, epic games, etc.
So I thought I'd whip this up real quick.

It just uses [IndieGameBundles](https://www.indiegamebundles.com/category/free/ "IndieGameBundles") as it's source for information (will probably be expanded soon)

Currently, this just will let you know when _anything_ new is listed on the site. Hopefully I can update this to include a way to send alerts according to preferences
