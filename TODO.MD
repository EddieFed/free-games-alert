# TO DO
 - ~~Phone verification~~
 - ~~Site CSS (enough to not make it look shit)~~
 - Add more carriers (maybe use a library to determine carrier for me)
 - Add options to toggle which sites you want texts for sites include:
   - Steam
   - Epic games
   - Twitch Prime
   - IndieGala
   - GOG
 - Add a discord bot variation
 - Come up with a better name
 - Outsource the sites CSS, it's garbage
